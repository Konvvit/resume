Project Structure and Design Philosophy:

In order to streamline the management of information across the React resume project, I have adopted a modular and data-driven approach. To avoid hardcoding and enhance maintainability, I've introduced a centralized component named resumeData. This component serves as a repository for all the essential data used throughout the website.

Key Features:

Centralized Data Storage:

The resumeData component acts as a central hub for storing and organizing project-related information.
Enhanced Reusability:

By consolidating data into a single component, other modules can easily access and reuse specific information without the need for repetitive hardcoding.
Dynamic Updates with useState:

The portfolio component leverages the useState hook to dynamically manage the selected tab and project dialog, ensuring a seamless and interactive user experience.
This structured approach not only improves code readability but also facilitates scalability and ease of future updates to the project.
